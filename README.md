### "project1"

This is a minimal project designed to improve certain coding habits and skills, couched as a basic "register a user" service.

It has a few technologies that I'm playing around with (and have very little skill in, relatively):
+ docker
+ golang
+ redis

Next thing you know I'll put this on the blockchain and take my ICO and retire.
